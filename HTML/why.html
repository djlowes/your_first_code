    <h1><span class="h11">List of </span><span class ="h12">benefits</span></h1>
    <p><span class="alttext2">Source: http://www.wonderslist.com/10-health-benefits-of-fasting/</span></p>
    <p class="alttext1">1. Fasting Promotes Detoxification</p>
    <p>The act of fasting promotes detoxification, since fat is burned and toxins are released. As the body breaks down its fat reserves, it mobilizes and eliminates stored toxins.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">2. Fasting Improves Insulin Sensitivity</p>
    <p>Fasting improves insulin sensitivity (which is a very big deal). When your cells are tickled by the effects of insulin, they do a much better job modulating your blood sugar levels after meals and this makes life a lot easier for your poor old pancreas.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">3. Fasting Rests Digestive System</p>
    <p>During fasting, the digestive organs rest. Fasting gives the digestive system a much-needed rest. After fasting, both digestion and elimination are invigorated.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">4. Fasting Boosts Immunity</p>
    <p>Fasting boosts immunity if one is careful not to break their fast with an abnormally excessive amount of food. Fruits contain vitamins A and E which boost immunity so one should take care of their balanced diet in between fasts if this is to take place. Fruits should be eaten a lot while breaking the fast.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">5. Fasting Corrects High Blood Pressure</p>
    <p>Fasting corrects high blood pressure without drugs. Fasting will normalize blood pressure in the vast majority of cases, the blood pressure will remain low after the fast, if the person follows a health-supporting diet and lifestyle.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">6. Fasting May Help to Overcome Addictions</p>
    <p>Fasting makes it easy to overcome bad habits and addictions. Many people have overcome tobacco and alcohol addictions by fasting, and even drug addictions. Fasting rapidly dissipates the craving for nicotine, alcohol, caffeine and other drugs.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">7. Fasting Promotes Weight Loss</p>
    <p>Fasting initiates rapid weight loss with little or no hunger. It reduces the store of fats in the body. However fasting is not a good weight loss strategy. Reducing fat and sugar intake, and increasing fruits and rest are better measures to achieve weight reduction.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">8. Fasting Resolves Inflammatory Response</p>
    <p>Some studies show that fasting triggers resolution of inflammatory diseases and allergies, examples of such being arthritis and skin diseases such as psoriasis. Some experts even suggest that fasting could magically heal the inflammatory bowel diseases such as ulcerative colitis.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">9. Fasting Promotes Healthy Diet</p>
    <p>Fasting is the perfect gateway to a healthful diet and lifestyle. Going on a fast gives you the motivation and enthusiasm to make a fresh start. It has been observed that fasting reduces craving for processed foods. It promotes desire for natural foods, especially water and fruits.</p>
    <p><span class="alttext1">10. Fasting Clears the Skin and Whitens the Eyes</p>
    <p>Fasting clears the skin and whitens the eyes. It is common to see skin eruptions clear while fasting, and the whites of the eyes never look so clear and bright as they do after fasting.</p>
